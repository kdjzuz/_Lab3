While both sources provide data for various types of violent crime, I filtered the data to only include fatal and non-fatal shootings.\nHistorically, gun violence in Chicago has been concentrated in Black and Hispanic neighborhoods. After pulling gun violence data, I also looked at the racial breakdowns of the data and the age breakdown. What I found is that the South and West side neighborhoods experience the highest shooting rates, which are also largely inhabited by Black residents. The second demographic that is disproportionately affected by gun violence in Chicago are those of Latin American backgrounds."
